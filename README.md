# QGIS
QGIS Projects, resources and templates used for reviewing and interacting with Planning Data collections and data sets.

## Directory Structure 

```
project - holds map files with links to data 
project/data - holds static data files used in the maps
template - holds template files for use in creating new projects
````

Set Project -> Properties... -> General -> Save Path = "Relative", this enables easier sharing as data files can be stored in the same file structure as their parent project map files.
