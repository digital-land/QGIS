# QGIS
QGIS Projects, resources and templates used for reviewing and interacting with Planning Data collections and data sets.

Download QGIS from https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

These projects and resources were built using QGIS 3.24.3.

## Directory Structure 

```
project - holds map files with links to data 
project/data - holds static data files used in the maps
template - holds template files for use in creating new projects
````

Set Project -> Properties... -> General -> Save Path = "Relative", this enables easier sharing as data files can be stored in the same file structure as their parent project map files. 

Project Templates typically need to be copied into your user profile project_templates directory.  Use the menu option Settings -> User Profile -> Open Active Profile Folder to find this.
